## SELF INTRO

Hello, my name is Dilip. I am a first-year student studying Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) . I have a passion for problem-solving and enjoy tackling challenging tasks. One of my strengths is my ability to understand concepts quickly, and I'm known for my determination—I won't give up on a problem until I find a solution. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in my field of study.

## INTROSPECTION

### WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME
You should choose me because of my unwavering determination and commitment to excellence. I refuse to give up easily, always striving to produce the best version of myself. While it may take me a bit longer to complete tasks compared to others, it's because I meticulously work towards achieving the optimal outcome. I excel in handling challenging situations, thriving in team environments where I can leverage my strong collaboration skills. My eagerness to learn is insatiable—I actively seek out new opportunities for growth, and am particularly drawn to the resources and opportunities provided by amfoss. Joining your club would not only satisfy my curiosity but also allow me to push my boundaries further. I am prepared to go to any extent to overcome challenges and contribute meaningfully to the team's success. Additionally, I have a knack for quickly understanding situations and taking control, ensuring efficient problem-solving and effective decision-making.

### WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
Over the next six months, my primary focus will be on personal growth and development. I have recognized the need to enhance my skills across various domains, and I am fully committed to this endeavor. My plan involves engaging in tasks and activities that challenge me and push me out of my comfort zone. By tackling these tasks head-on, I aim to transform myself into the best possible version, continuously striving for improvement in every aspect of my life. My ultimate goal is to become an exemplary individual in my chosen field, and I am determined to put in the necessary effort to achieve this. With dedication and perseverance, I am confident that I can make significant progress towards realizing my aspirations over the next six months.

### HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
When considering how I would contribute back to the club, one thing stands out: my unwavering commitment to giving my utmost effort. I firmly believe in giving 120 percent in everything I do, and I will apply this dedication to my contributions within the club. Whether it's providing assistance where needed, leveraging all my abilities to contribute effectively, or focusing on areas that require improvement, I am fully committed to making a significant difference. My primary aim will be to identify and address any weaknesses, utilizing my skills and resources to enhance our collective efforts and drive positive outcomes for the club. Rest assured, I am dedicated to utilizing my capabilities to their fullest potential in order to contribute meaningfully and help the club thrive.

###DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
Regarding the selection process, I have some feedback to share. It's important to acknowledge that many individuals, including myself, are new to coding and the technical environment. Some may even lack basic computer skills, which can pose a significant challenge. Personally, while I have a strong foundation in MPC, I am essentially starting from scratch in coding. I require guidance and time to learn and adapt to this new field. One common issue I've noticed is that during time-constrained situations with a heavy workload, individuals tend to prioritize output over understanding the process. This can result in incomplete comprehension and less than optimal contributions. Often, individuals focus solely on completing tasks rather than investing the effort required for a full 100 percent contribution. Later, some may attempt to cram coding knowledge for interviews, which is not conducive to long-term learning. I've been eager to join since my first semester, but unfortunately, by the time I completed my courses, the selection process had already concluded. I had harbored numerous aspirations about joining the club early on, and it's disheartening that those dreams were not realized.
